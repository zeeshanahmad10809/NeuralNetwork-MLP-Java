# Neural Network (Multi Layer Perceptron) from Scratch
A multi-layer perceptron trained using **Backpropagation** in Java for Multi-class Classification. The algorithm has been implemented from scratch without using any package or library. All the computation operations has been implemented from scratch. The code is designed using **Object Oriented Programming(OOP)** approach considering robustness & reuseability.

The algorithm has been designed to comprise any number of hidden layers and any number of nodes in a layer. The algorithm can be used as multi-class classifier. So far it has been trained and tested on two datasets few **Urdu Language Alphabets** and **Iris Flower Dataset** for multi-class classification.

It uses **sigmoid** activation function in hidden layers of model and **softmax** in output layer used for multi-class classification. The error calculated for **softmax** output is **Cross Entropy Loss**.
